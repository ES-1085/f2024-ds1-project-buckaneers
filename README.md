Agricultural Practices & Their Impacts on Soil Organic Matter
================
by Aronah Swartz, Clastel Patrik, and Blake Berry

## Summary

Agricultural practices have been discovered to have adverse effects on soil health and the quality of soils. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have developed practices that may harm soil health and its essential properties. This project was based on a data set of soil qualities and properties from 218 different farmlands across Wisconsin and Minnesota from 2015 to 2017. The dataset explores how soil properties (e.g., texture, pH, and drainage class), as well as soil organic matter (SOM), are affected by specific farming and agricultural practices. Practices used among these farms include rotation of crops, tillage type and frequency (e.g., no-till, conventional till), use of cover crops, and manure application (e.g., timing, type, and frequency). We found that certain livestock have more effects on soil qualities like pH and that the amount of soil tilling can heavily impact the health and presence of water drainage in soil.
