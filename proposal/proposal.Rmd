## 1. Introduction

  We are analyzing the influence of inherent soil factors and agricultural management on soil organic matter. Our data comes from a coalition of 218 farms and fields across Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. The data was collected using single variable and regression tree analysis to examine the soil characteristics: texture, drainage, and pH in relation to tillage, animal husbandry, cover cropping, manure application, and crop rotation.
